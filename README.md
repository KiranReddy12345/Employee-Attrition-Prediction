The term "Employee Attrition" describes when employees leave a company, either
voluntarily or involuntarily. Due to the considerable influence, it could have on
the organizationâ€™s productivity and financial situation, it is one of the most urgent
concerns that most businesses around the world are currently dealing with. As a
result, companies must begin developing incredibly specific strategies to predict
and avoid such a crisis, and it is in these circumstances that machine learning proves
useful (to model the data and offer insights). This, together with the increased
interest in machine learning for commercial decision-making, makes it necessary
to go more into this area. Therefore, in this study, we have used Decision Trees,
Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and K Nearest neighbors algorithm to
predict Employee Attrition. Through a thorough evaluation process, we choose the
best model based on the accuracy of these models in predicting employee attrition.
